## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m **Peter**, a self-taught frontend developer passionate about crafting **clean, responsive, and visually engaging web experiences**.

I mainly work with **React**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**, and I’m currently exploring **GSAP** for smooth animations.

My path wasn’t typical — I studied **electrical engineering**, worked as an **electronics technician**, and later served in the army as a **communication specialist**. After leaving the army for health reasons, I decided to give programming a real chance — and it quickly became my passion.

I’m a **dynamic and curious person** who loves learning new things and improving every day. Outside coding, I enjoy **gym training, gaming, and watching anime**.

Outside of coding, I enjoy:  
🏋️ training at the gym  
🎮 playing games  
🎌 watching anime
